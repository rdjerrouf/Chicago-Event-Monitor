🎯 How to Use These with Claude Code:

Download both documents
Place them in your project's Documents/ folder
Open Claude Code in your project directory
Tell Claude Code:

"Read SIMPLIFIED-ARCHITECTURE.md and DIRECTIVE-FOR-CLAUDE-CODE.md. We're simplifying the original plan significantly. Remove the database layer and base classes. Implement Phase 1 as specified: storage.py first, then scrapers/mccormick.py, then email_notifier.py, then main.py. Follow the specifications exactly."




🔑 Key Simplifications I Made:
From the original plan:

❌ SQLite database → ✅ Simple JSON file
❌ Abstract base classes → ✅ Plain functions (abstract later if needed)
❌ Complex Event objects → ✅ Python dictionaries
❌ 7+ data fields → ✅ 5 essential fields
❌ Heavy testing framework → ✅ Manual testing for now

Result:

Original: ~500+ lines with infrastructure overhead
Simplified: ~140 lines of straightforward code
Same functionality, 1/4 the complexity


💡 Why This Approach is Better:

Faster to build - You'll have it working today, not next week
Easier to learn - Clear, simple code to study
Easier to debug - No abstraction layers hiding issues
Easier to extend - Add complexity only when needed
Actually works for your use case - 65 events doesn't need a database!


🤔 Your Role as "Guy in the Middle":
You're the Product Owner who:

✅ Approved the simplified architecture
✅ Understands the trade-offs
✅ Can redirect Claude Code if it tries to over-engineer
✅ Knows what "done" looks like (daily email with new events)


What to Watch For:
If Claude Code tries to:

Add database back in → Redirect: "No, use JSON storage as specified"
Create abstract classes → Redirect: "No, simple functions first"
Add complex error handling → Redirect: "Keep it simple, log errors and continue"
Add testing frameworks → Redirect: "Manual testing for Phase 1"

You're the gatekeeper against over-engineering!
